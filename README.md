# Self-Sustained Instagram Automation Bot

Completely self-sustained **hands-free** Instagram automation bot which operates and manages an Instagram account on its own:

* **Creating Unique Posts** üì∑ (Really!)
* Uploading posts
* Liking posts
* Following Users
* Unfollowing Non-Followers

The main object is to imitate a real user browsing & use, which randomly performs each task.

**Each post is created by blending two random images from Pixabay latest keyword search results (random search keyword from a list), and adding a text (quote from csv file) to the final blended image result.**

**Each text quote is created by a random chosen font, with a random chosen size and a random chosen color.**

Image size is determined by the smallest width/height size of source images. The images are cropped exactly from the middle of each image to a **perfect square blended image**, suitable for Instagram postings. Example:

![image-creation][image-creation]

## Prerequisites

* Instagram account.
* [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/service/about/api/).
* Quotes list (or any other text you want to display on an image post) in a CSV file.

## Getting Started

Add popular quotes (or any) list to CSV file (example.csv) and rename file to '`quotes.csv`'.

**That's it! On the default current settings each task is excuted randomly every few hours.**

## Usage (main functions default values)

**Follow new people with specific attributes:**

`Object.discover_people(follow_max=11, has_max_followers=15000, has_min_followers=450, follow_ratio=2)`
